# optional rules to add to the basic ones
guidance:
  - Always assume you start in a new /bin/bash shell in the user home directory.
  - Prefer using full paths to files and directories.
  - Use the /tmp directory for any file write operations.
  - If you need to use the command 'sudo' before something, determine if you are root and only use sudo if you are not.
